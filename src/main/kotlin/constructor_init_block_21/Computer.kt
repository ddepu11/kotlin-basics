package constructor_init_block_21

//In Kotlin, the primary constructor of a class can include an initialization block,
// which is executed when an instance of the class is created.
// This initialization block is defined using the init keyword.
// The init block allows you to execute code that should run as part of the instance initialization,
// similar to how you might use a constructor or initializer block in other programming languages.
