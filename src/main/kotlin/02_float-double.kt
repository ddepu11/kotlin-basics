fun main() {
//    Float and double are used when you want to store fractional numbers

//    By default its double
//    val myNumber = 45.5

//    Cant give type to the variable like this coz the 45.5 infered as double type
//    val myNumber:Float = 45.5


//  solution of above
    val myNumber = 45.5f

//  Double type variable
    val mySecondNumber = 65.6


//    Double has more precision

}
